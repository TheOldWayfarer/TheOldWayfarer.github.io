Hello,
If you are reading this, then you have managed to stumble upon my quiet and possibly transient blog. Here I will be covering my journey into “The Old World” by Games Workshop. Basically, I only ever played a handful of Warhammer Fantasy games when I was in elementary school. I used to go to the GW store and participate in the Mega Battle Sundays; they had it structured so that people could come in and play store-hosted games with the store’s own models1.">

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>If you are reading this, then you have managed to stumble upon my quiet and possibly transient blog. Here I will be covering my journey into &ldquo;The Old World&rdquo; by Games Workshop. Basically, I only ever played a handful of Warhammer Fantasy games when I was in elementary school. I used to go to the GW store and participate in the Mega Battle Sundays; they had it structured so that people could come in and play store-hosted games with the store&rsquo;s own models<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. First, we played 40K for 2–3 hours, then Warhammer Fantasy for 2–3 hours, and sometimes Lord of the Rings Battle for Middle Earth. But most of the time, no one played that last one at my location. Anyway, my friends and I loved sci-fi, so we would play 40K, then when the fantasy time came, they all usually left, and I was alone<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, and personally, sci-fi was just my preference, I guess, so I never really played the fantasy games or even looked at them much. Fast-forward to 2021/2022, and we started to hear that the Old World was looking to come back, and at first I was not that interested. I still preferred sci-fi at the time, but as I started to get into AOS, I found that a lot of my apprehension around the fantasy genre started to break down, and I began to find a newfound appreciation for this genre and setting.</p>
<p>After that, I started to eye The Old World with a bit of curiosity. I know the two aren&rsquo;t similar in any way, but after I really got into AOS lore and setting<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, I actually gained an appreciation for the more &ldquo;old school&rdquo; fantasy that I feel the Old World portrays. So, I began to pay attention to The Old World, cutting to the releases at the beginning of 2024, the core sets. Instantly, I was very intrigued by the Bretonnia set<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, and the core set seemed like a really great deal: approximately 1.2k points, a full core rule book, a sample list based upon the miniatures in the set<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>, and then dice and templates. Just seeing that, I felt this seemed like a bit of a different direction from the recent 40K releases and the AOS releases, in my eyes at least.</p>
<p>While reading all this, you might be thinking that&rsquo;s great and all, but what even is the Old World? Is it just 40K fantasy but old school? Well, it&rsquo;s not, but I will explain. Warhammer The Old World is a rank-and-flank specialty game from GW that utilizes the same setting as the older Warhammer Fantasy Battle. Some of the factions available in this game range from chivalric feudal knights who ride on Pegasi and worship a mysterious Lady of the Lake, of course your orcs and goblins, undead armies controlled by vampires and necromancers all the way to Chaos dwarves, funny enough, which I don&rsquo;t think I have seen depicted before. Dwarves usually aren&rsquo;t corrupted in most fantasy media.</p>
<p>Already that gives us questions: what is a rank and flank game? What is a specialty game? In layman terms, basically, a rank and flank miniature game requires you to instead put your troops into a formation of some kind. This allows your unit to have an objective front, flank, and rear and also requires them to stay within the formation, whereas in 40K and AOS, while you do have to stay together, your formation is pretty much not a solid thing and the individual models in the unit have a lot more freedom. While this might sound just a lot more rigid and not enjoyable, it does allow for a lot of granularity; it allows for things like vision arcs for the units, flanks that can be hit and thus taken advantage of, and probably lots more things that I have either forgotten or slipped my mind as I have not played a game yet. Regarding the specialty game question, well, my understanding at least is that it&rsquo;s a GW game that will be supported but not updated nearly as often as 40K, which can be a good thing. I love 40K and will probably always play it on and off for the rest of my life, but already as a busy individual it can be really hard to keep up with the hobby<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. This leaves me sometimes in a situation where, by the time I get my list actually ready or everything put together and somewhat painted, I am already super behind in the scene, whether it&rsquo;s a new season or point changes everywhere, which kind of nullifies my list as I can&rsquo;t even fit all the units the same anymore as some are more expensive or are now kind of bad. So, this concept of fewer updates is a double-edged sword, but it is one I am going to try and wield. Chainmail gloves, anyone? We still have barely covered anything about this game, but already we can kind of set some expectations on what to expect here, as some people might want a game more updated and constantly being errata&rsquo;d and updated, and some might prefer or at least be open to the Old World&rsquo;s slower cycle.</p>
<p>So, I followed along, watching the releases and keeping a distance for months, but my interest never waned. I checked out the initial rule reveals as they were happening, and each one only worsened my pining for this game. May 2024 was the month that changed it all. I decided to really delve more into The Old World and put this question to rest: am I going to play The Old World? I think first and foremost for me is that I want to know if the game is &ldquo;fun.&rdquo; I may not play that many games in reality, but that is always my goal. Thus, after watching a few battle reports and listening to some impressions of the gameplay, I decided the prerequisite had been passed. Next, I had to narrow down the factions that I would play, and at least pick one that I can start with. I had a few requirements:</p>
<h4 id="requirements">Requirements</h4>
<ul>
<li>Simple and easy as possible to start, as I am new to both this setting and game.</li>
<li>Not elves.</li>
</ul>
<figure class="small"><img src="/images/my_post/factions_list.jpg"
    alt="You can see the factions here, these don&amp;rsquo;t even include the very valid legacy factions"><figcaption>
      <p>You can see the factions here, these don&rsquo;t even include the very valid legacy factions</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>So these first two points took out the legacy factions and of course the Elves. Next, I had to decide okay which of these would I play? And factor in availability of factions/models as well as I don&rsquo;t want to pick an army just for the sake of playing now versus later I had to be happy with the current selection now, regardless of whether I would own more than one faction. On the good factions (as The Old world is a lot more black and white than modern fiction, not so much grey in this setting) this left me with Empire of Man (Holy Roman Empire), Kingdom of Bretonnia (Arthurian/medieval France on pegasi), or Dwarves, all of which I would personally play, but I have always loved the look of the Bretonnians, their weird out-of-place chivalry in this world and the fact that they seem to worship some Lady from a Lake, to me that all sounds awesome and possibly like a recipe for disaster, lore wise. So, side wise, I got Bretonnia selected, next up the bad side. Orcs &amp; Goblin Tribes which while they are just what they are, Orcs and Goblins in GW games are always just a ton of fun and random, Warriors of Chaos, they look pretty awesome, and who doesn&rsquo;t love humans willing to throw away all their humanity and betray all living things for some Lovecraftian otherworldly deities? Beast men, um goatmen? And Tomb Kings, egyptian undead, this seems a bit cool but honestly at this point the Bretonnian blinders are on, and I cannot fully appreciate these, but I would not write any off or call them lame/boring. BRETONNIA IT IS, FOR THE LADY!</p>

    alt="Look at how vast this map is"><figcaption>

<p>I think I will end this here, but there&rsquo;s a lot to talk about, maybe we talk about Bretonnia, the game? Both? IDK</p>
<p>Maybe we can do a more why play Old World post? Focusing on more about the factions/world/rules or any one of those, I don&rsquo;t have comments yet so uh, email <a href="mailto:teeeballer@gmail.com">teeeballer@gmail.com</a> if you care.</p>
